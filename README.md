# Library Internal Management Application

Welcome to the **Library Internal Management Application** project! This project was developed during my summer internship at Agevole Innovation Private Limited. It is designed to streamline library operations and enhance user experience. Below is a detailed account of the project's progress and the technologies used.

## Project Overview

The Library Internal Management Application is a web-based application that allows librarians to manage books, track borrowing and returning of books, manage user accounts, and generate insightful reports. The system includes functionalities such as:

- **Book Management**: Add, update, and delete books from the inventory.
- **User Management**: Register, update, and manage user profiles.
- **Transaction Management**: Handle the borrowing and returning of books.
- **Search and Filtering**: Search for books and users, filter results based on various criteria.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports on book availability and user activities.

- **Day 16**: Integrated React hooks to manage component lifecycle and optimize performance.
- **Day 17**: Worked on user registration and authentication, allowing users to sign up and log in to the system.
- **Day 18**: Created components for managing books, including adding, editing, and deleting book entries.

### Week 4: Back-End Development with Node.js and Express

- **Day 19**: Set up the server using Node.js and Express, handling routing and middleware configuration.
- **Day 20**: Connected the application to a MongoDB database to manage book and user data.
- **Day 21**: Developed API endpoints for book and user management, ensuring secure and efficient data handling.
- **Day 22**: Implemented user authentication and authorization using JWT to protect sensitive routes.
- **Day 23**: Added error handling and validation to the back-end to ensure robust data processing.
- **Day 24**: Deployed the initial version of the back-end to a cloud service for testing and feedback.

### Week 5: Additional Features and Integrations

- **Day 25**: Developed the loan and return system, managing book lending and returning processes.
- **Day 26**: Implemented notifications for due dates and overdue books, enhancing user experience.
- **Day 27**: Added search and filtering functionalities for books and users.
- **Day 28**: Developed the inventory management system, tracking book stock levels and managing new acquisitions.
- **Day 29**: Created a reporting module, generating reports on book availability and user activities.
- **Day 30**: Enhanced the user interface with animations and improved overall user experience.

### Week 6: Finalizing and Optimizing the System

- **Day 31**: Conducted thorough testing of the application, fixing bugs and ensuring all features work as expected.
- **Day 32**: Implemented security measures, including data encryption and secure API endpoints.
- **Day 33**: Optimized the performance of the application by caching queries and optimizing database interactions.
- **Day 34**: Integrated the application with external systems (e.g., school databases, e-book platforms).
- **Day 35**: Deployed the final version of the application and prepared documentation for users and administrators.
