## Project Overview

**Objective**: Develop an internal management application for our library to streamline operations and enhance user experience.

**Scope**: The application manages book cataloging, user profiles, loan/return processes, inventory management, and generates insightful reports.

## Key Features

1. **Catalog Management**
   - Add, update, and delete book records.
   - Categorize books for easy searching and filtering.

2. **User Management**
   - Manage user profiles and track borrowing history.
   - Send notifications for due dates and overdue books.

3. **Loan and Return System**
   - Simplify book lending and returning processes.
   - Automatically calculate due dates and fines for late returns.

4. **Inventory Management**
   - Track inventory levels and alert for low stock.
   - Manage new acquisitions and report on popular books.

5. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Generate comprehensive usage reports.
   - Dashboard for real-time insights.
   - Export data for external use.

6. **Integration**
   - Sync with school/university databases.
   - Integrate with e-book platforms.
   - Support for API integrations.

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js.
- **Frontend**: React.js.
- **Database**: MongoDB for data storage.
- **Other Tools**: Redux for state management, Mongoose for MongoDB interactions.

### Database Design

- **Books**: Stores book information (title, author, category, availability).
- **Users**: Stores user profiles and borrowing history.
- **Loans**: Tracks book loans and returns.
- **Inventory**: Manages book stock levels and acquisitions.

### Security

- Implement authentication and authorization.
- Use JWT for secure user sessions.
- Ensure data encryption and secure API endpoints.

### Scalability

- Design the application to handle a growing number of users and books.
- Implement efficient database indexing and query optimization.

### Accessibility

- Ensure the application complies with accessibility standards (WCAG).
- Provide support for users with disabilities.

## Development Process

1. **Requirement Analysis**
   - Gather detailed requirements from library staff and users through meetings and surveys.

2. **Design**
   - Create wireframes and UI/UX mockups.
   - Design the database schema to support all functionalities.

3. **Development**
   - Develop backend APIs using Node.js and Express.js.
   - Build the frontend interface with React.js.
   - Integrate the database using MongoDB and Mongoose.

4. **Testing**
   - Perform unit testing for individual components.
   - Conduct integration testing to ensure components work together seamlessly.
   - Carry out user acceptance testing with library staff and users.

5. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the application on a cloud server (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
   - Ensure secure access and data protection.

6. **Maintenance**
   - Provide regular updates and technical support.
   - Gather user feedback and implement improvements continuously.
